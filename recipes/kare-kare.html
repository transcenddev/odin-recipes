      <div class="recipe-desc">
        <p>
          This oxtail kare kare is a richly flavored stew thanks to
          slow-simmered oxtail. The oxtail can be cooked a day ahead, so you can
          skim off the fat to make the dish a little healthier. Using a pressure
          cooker will reduce the cooking time, but the stew won't be as
          flavorful. Serve with rice and bagoóng (shrimp paste).

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Bring oxtails and water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat
              to medium-low and simmer until tender, at least 2 hours, adding
              more water as necessary. Skim as much fat from the top of the
              liquid as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer oxtails to a plate. Crumble beef bouillon cubes into the
              pot and stir to dissolve. Add bok choy, beans, and eggplant and
              simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the vegetables are simmering, heat olive oil in a large pot
              over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until
              tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in achiote powder. Stir in peanut
              butter until melted. Add about 1/2 of the simmering broth and
              simmer for 5 minutes. Add oxtails and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer
              remaining broth and vegetables to the pot and stir to combine.
              Serve hot.
